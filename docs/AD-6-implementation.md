# Implementation Documentation for AD-6

To update the greeting message in the Spring Boot application, the following change was made:

1. In the HelloController class (src/main/java/com/example/springboot/HelloController.java), the return value of the index() method was changed from "Hello from Spring Boot with Kafka!" to "hayabusa".

This change updates the message that is returned when the root URL of the application is accessed. The @RestController annotation ensures that the returned string is written directly to the HTTP response body.

No other changes were necessary as the application structure and functionality remain the same. The updated message will be displayed to users when they access the application.
