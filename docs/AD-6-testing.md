# Testing Steps for AD-6

To verify that the greeting message has been updated correctly, follow these testing steps:

1. Ensure the Spring Boot application is running.
2. Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to send a GET request to the root URL of the application (e.g., http://localhost:8080/).
3. Verify that the response body contains the updated greeting message "hayabusa".
4. Ensure that the application still functions correctly and there are no errors or exceptions.

If the response displays the new greeting message and the application behaves as expected, the implementation is considered successful.
