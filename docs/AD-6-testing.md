# Testing Steps for AD-6

1. Ensure the Spring Boot application is running.
2. Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to send a GET request to the root URL of the application (e.g., http://localhost:8080/).
3. Verify that the response body contains the updated greeting message "hayabusa".
4. Test the application's functionality to ensure that the update did not introduce any regressions or break existing features.
