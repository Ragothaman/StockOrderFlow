# Testing Steps for AD-6

To verify that the greeting message has been successfully updated, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the Spring Boot application is running.
2. Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to send a GET request to the root URL of the application (e.g., http://localhost:8080/).
3. Verify that the response body contains the updated greeting message "hayabusa".
4. Confirm that the application is still functioning correctly and there are no errors or exceptions.
