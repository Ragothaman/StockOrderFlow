# Testing Steps for AD-6

To verify that the greeting message has been updated correctly, follow these testing steps:

1. Ensure that the Spring Boot application is running.
2. Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to send a GET request to the root URL of the application (e.g., http://localhost:8080/).
3. Check that the response body contains the updated greeting message "hayabusa".
4. Verify that there are no errors or exceptions in the application logs.

If the updated message is displayed correctly and the application functions as expected, the change can be considered successful.
