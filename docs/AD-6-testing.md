# Testing Steps for AD-6

To verify the greeting message update:

1. Ensure the Spring Boot application is running.
2. Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to send a GET request to the root URL ("/") of the application.
3. Verify that the response body contains the updated greeting message "hayabusa".
4. Confirm that the application is still functioning correctly and there are no errors or exceptions.

If the response contains "hayabusa" and the application is running without issues, the greeting message update has been successfully implemented.
