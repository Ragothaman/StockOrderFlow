# Testing Steps for AD-6

To verify that the greeting message has been successfully updated, follow these testing steps:

1. Ensure the Spring Boot application is running.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the root URL of the application (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
3. Verify that the page displays the new greeting message "hayabusa".
4. Interact with other parts of the application, if applicable, to ensure the overall functionality remains intact.

If the new greeting message is displayed correctly and the application functions as expected, the implementation can be considered successful.
