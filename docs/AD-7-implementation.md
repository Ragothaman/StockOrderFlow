# Implementation Documentation for AD-7

This implementation creates a basic Spring Boot application with Kafka dependencies. The key steps are:

1. Set up a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or manually.
2. Add the spring-kafka dependency to the pom.xml file to include Kafka support.
3. Create the main application class annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
4. Create a simple REST controller with a /greeting endpoint that returns a greeting message.

With these steps, we have a functioning Spring Boot application that includes the necessary Kafka dependencies. This sets the foundation for implementing Kafka messaging features in the application.
